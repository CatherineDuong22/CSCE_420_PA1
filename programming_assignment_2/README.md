# Welcome To Catherine's Tic-Tac-Toe!!!

This is a program where you can either play with someone else (or yourself), or you can play with our very POWERFUL A.I PLAYER!

(hint: YOU CAN NEVER WIN AGAINST IT)

## Instructions for play:
- This is simply a command-line tic-tac-toe. You can just type in your desired turn directly in this format - move X A 1 (put piece P (X or O) in row R (A, B, or C) and column C (1, 2, or 3))
- If you wants to play against the A.I, simply put in this command - choose X (invoke Minimax to figure out the optimal place to put piece P on the board)
- Other command you can try: 
  - `show`: shows the current state of the board, 
  - `reset`: resets the state of the board to empty (removes all the pieces), 
  - `pruning`: show the state of pruning (on or off), 
  - `pruning_on | pruning_off`: turn alpha-beta pruning on or off, 
  - `quit`

* This program is powered by Minimax algorithm, as well as Alpha-Beta Pruning.
